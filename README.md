## Configuration

Set the following environment variables (or supply them through a `.env` file) before running the service:

- `MONGO_DB_USERNAME`
- `MONGO_DB_PASSWORD`

This keeps credentials outside of the repository while preserving the existing workflow.

## Container build and deploy
- Build and push instructions for Docker + Google Artifact Registry are in `DOCKER_DEPLOY.md`.
